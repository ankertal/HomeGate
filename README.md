# HomeGate -- Your Gate but Smarter !

This repository contains a fun project for an electronic gate controller. 
It uses a Raspberry Pi as a transmitter to a gate. The commands are triggered 
via an *HomeGate* server.

# Build the Frontend

Make sure npm is installed:

```
    cd server/cmd/homegate/frontend
    npm install
    # to serve for testing
    # npm run serve

    # to build dist for production
    npm run build
```
